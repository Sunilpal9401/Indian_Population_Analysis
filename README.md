## Problem Statements and Approach
 A general overview of the Indian population using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool developed by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and analyze data. Here's how I created the Indian population in Power BI:

 1. Data Source: The data was download from Kaggle as of 2011 census. The excel File is also provided here.
 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Imported the data into Power BI and clean it up. This involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting the data appropriately.
 3. Population Trends: Created visualizations that shows the population trends in India over time  to display the population growth rate over the years. This help identify patterns and 
    trends in population growth.
 4. Population Distribution: Created visualizations that illustrate the distribution of the population across different regions of India. You can filters, cards to show the population by 
    state or district.
 5. Urban vs. Rural Population: Compared the urban and rural population in India using Power BI. Created a chart to show the proportion of urban and rural residents.
 6. Interactive Dashboard: Combined all the visualizations into an interactive dashboard where users can explore the data dynamically. Added slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities 
    to allow users to analyze the population data from different perspectives.
